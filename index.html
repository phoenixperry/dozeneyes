				<h3>Working to Make Games Better</h3>
				<p>Phoenix Perry fights to change gender ratios in games with Code Liberation. Ben Johnson's work with Babycastles challenges ideas about what games can be. Together, as Dozen Eyes, we collaborate not just to make better games, but to make games better.</p></li>

				<h3>Choosing My Way</h3>
				<div class="bioText">
					<p>In December of 2014, they released their first title, Choosing My Way with the US State Department in conjunction with the Center for Applied Linguistics. This game helps political refugees adjust to their new lives in the United States. Players decide how to respond to opportunities and challenges after resettlement. They prioritize goals, collect resources, and react to situations they will likely face in their new home country.</p>

				<h3>Many Faces at the New York Historical Society</h3>
				<div class="bioText">
					<p>Also during 2014, they worked with the New York Historical Society on their exhibit, Many Faces, which educates gallery goers to the history of Chinese Americans. They developed four interactive pieces, the most elaborate of which is the Many Faces entry exhibit. It allows viewers to add themselves to the show’s database online and they are displayed in animated data visualization alongside historical Chinese Americans of note. </p>
